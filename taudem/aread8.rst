D8 Contributing Area
====================

Description
-----------

Calculates a grid of contributing areas using the single direction D8 flow model.
The contribution of each grid cell is taken as one (or when the optional weight
grid is used, the value from the weight grid). The contributing area for each
grid cell is taken as its own contribution plus the contribution from upslope
neighbors that drain in to it according to the D8 flow model.

If the optional outlet point shapefile is used, only the outlet cells and the
cells upslope (by the D8 flow model) of them are in the domain to be evaluated.

By default, the tool checks for edge contamination. This is defined as the
possibility that a contributing area value may be underestimated due to grid
cells outside of the domain not being counted. This occurs when drainage is
inwards from the boundaries or areas with "no data" values for elevation. The
algorithm recognizes this and reports "no data" for the contributing area. It is
common to see streaks of "no data" values extending inwards from boundaries
along flow paths that enter the domain at a boundary. This is the desired effect
and indicates that contributing area for these grid cells is unknown due to it
being dependent on terrain outside of the domain of data available. Edge
contamination checking may be turned off in cases where you know this is not an
issue or want to ignore these problems, if for example, the DEM has been clipped
along a watershed outline.

Parameters
----------

- ``D8 Flow Direction Grid [Raster]``: A grid of D8 flow directions which are
  defined, for each cell, as the direction of the one of its eight adjacent or
  diagonal neighbors with the steepest downward slope. This grid can be obtained
  as the output of the **"D8 Flow Directions"** tool.
- ``Outlets Shapefile [Vector]``: Optional. A point shapefile defining the outlets
  of interest. If this input file is used, only the cells upslope of these outlet
  cells are considered to be within the domain being evaluated.
- ``Weight Grid [Raster]``: Optional. A grid giving contribution to flow for each
  cell. These contributions (also sometimes referred to as weights or loadings)
  are used in the contributing area accumulation. If this input file is not used,
  the contribution to flow will assumed to be one for each grid cell.
- ``Check for edge contamination [Boolean]``: A flag that indicates whether the
  tool should check for edge contamination. Edge contamination is defined as the
  possibility that a contributing area value may be underestimated due to the
  fact that grid cells outside of the domain have not been evaluated. This occurs
  when drainage is inwards from the boundaries or areas with "no data" values for
  elevation. The algorithm recognizes this and reports "no data" for the impated
  cells. It is common to see streaks of "no data" values extending inwards from
  boundaries along flow paths that enter the domain at a boundary. This is the
  desired effect and indicates that contributing area for these grid cells is
  unknown due to it being dependent on terrain outside of the domain of available
  data. Edge contamination checking may be turned off in cases where you know this
  is not an issue, or want to ignore these problems, if for example, the DEM has
  been clipped along a watershed outline. Default is **True**.

Outputs
-------

- ``D8 Contributing Area Grid [Raster]``: A grid of contributing area values
  calculated as the cells own contribution plus the contribution from upslope
  neighbors that drain in to it according to the D8 flow model.
