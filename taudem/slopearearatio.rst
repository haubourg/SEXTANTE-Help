Slope Over Area Ratio
=====================

Description
-----------

Calculates the ratio of the slope to the specific catchment area (contributing
area). This is algebraically related to the more common ln(a/tan beta) wetness
index, but contributing area is in the denominator to avoid divide by 0 errors
when slope is 0.

Parameters
----------

- ``Slope Grid [Raster]``: A grid of slope. This grid can be generated using ether
  the **"D8 Flow Directions"** tool or the **"D-Infinity Flow Directions"** tool.
- ``Specific Catchment Area Grid [Raster]``: A grid giving the contributing area
  value for each cell taken as its own contribution plus the contribution from
  upslope neighbors that drain in to it. Contributing area is counted in terms
  of the number of grid cells (or summation of weights). This grid can be
  generated using either the **"D8 Contributing Area"** tool or the **"D-Infinity
  Contributing Area"** tool.

Outputs
-------

- ``Slope Divided By Area Ratio Grid [Raster]``: A grid of the ratio of slope to
  specific catchment area (contributing area). This is algebraically related to
  the more common ``ln(a/tan beta)`` wetness index, but contributing area is in
  the denominator to avoid divide by 0 errors when slope is 0.
