Slope Average Down
==================

Description
-----------

This tool computes slope in a D8 downslope direction averaged over a user selected
distance. Distance should be specified in horizontal map units.

Parameters
----------

- ``D8 Flow Direction Grid [Raster]``: This input is a grid of flow directions
  that are encoded using the D8 method where all flow from a cells goes to a
  single neighboring cell in the direction of steepest descent.This grid can be
  obtained as the output of the **"D8 Flow Directions"** tool.
- ``Pit Filled Elevation Grid [Raster]``: This input is a grid of elevation
  values. As a general rule, it is recommended that you use a grid of elevation
  values that have had the pits removed for this input. Pits are generally taken
  to be artifacts that interfere with the analysis of flow across them. This grid
  can be obtained as the output of the **"Pit Remove"** tool, in which case it
  contains elevation values where the pits have been filled to the point where
  they just drain.
- ``Downslope Distance [Number]``: Input parameter of downslope distance over
  which to calculate the slope (in horizontal map units). Default **50**.

Outputs

- ``Slope Average Down Grid [Raster]``: This output is a grid of slopes calculated
  in the D8 downslope direction, averaged over the selected distance.
