D8 Distance To Streams
======================

Description
-----------

Computes the horizontal distance to stream for each grid cell, moving downslope
according to the D8 flow model, until a stream grid cell is encountered.

Parameters
----------

- ``D8 Flow Direction Grid [Raster]``: This input is a grid of flow directions
  that are encoded using the D8 method where all flow from a cells goes to a
  single neighboring cell in the direction of steepest descent. This grid can be
  obtained as the output of the **"D8 Flow Directions"** tool.
- ``Stream Raster Grid [Raster]``: A grid indicating streams. Such a grid can be
  created by several of the tools in the **"Stream Network Analysis"** toolset.
  However, the tools in the **"Stream Network Analysis"** toolset only create
  grids with a value of 0 for no stream, or 1 for stream cells. This tool can
  also accept grids with values greater than 1, which can be used in conjunction
  with the *Threshold* parameter to determine the location of streams. This allows
  Contributing Area grids to be used to define streams as well as the normal
  Stream Raster grids. This grid expects integer (long integer) values and any
  non-integer values will be truncated to an integer before being evaluated.
- ``Threshold [Number]``: This value acts as threshold on the *Stream Raster Grid*
  to determine the location of streams. Cells with a *Stream Raster Grid* value
  greater than or equal to the *Threshold* value are interpreted as streams.
  Default value **50**.

Outputs
-------

- ``Distance to Streams [Raster]``: A grid giving the horizontal distance along
  the flow path as defined by the D8 Flow Directions Grid to the streams in the
  Stream Raster Grid.
