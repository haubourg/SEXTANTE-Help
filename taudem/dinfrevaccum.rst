D-Infinity Reverse Accumulation
===============================

Description
-----------

This works in a similar way to evaluation of weighted Contributing area, except
that the accumulation is by propagating the weight loadings upslope along the
reverse of the flow directions to accumulate the quantity of weight loading
downslope from each grid cell. The function also reports the maximum value of
the weight loading downslope from each grid cell in the Maximum Downslope grid.

This function is designed to evaluate and map the hazard due to activities that
may have an effect downslope. The example is land management activities that
increase runoff. Runoff is sometimes a trigger for landslides or debris flows,
so the weight grid here could be taken as a terrain stability map. Then the
reverse accumulation provides a measure of the amount of unstable terrain
downslope from each grid cell, as an indicator of the danger of activities that
may increase runoff, even though there may be no potential for any local impact.

Parameters
----------

- ``D-Infinity Flow Direction Grid [Raster]``: A grid giving flow direction by
  the D-infinity method. Flow direction is measured in radians, counter clockwise
  from east. This can be created by the tool **"D-Infinity Flow Directions"**.</dd>
- ``Weight Grid [Raster]``: A grid giving weights (loadings) to be used in the
  accumulation.

Outputs
-------

- ``Reverse Accumulation Grid [Raster]``: The grid giving the result of the
  **"Reverse Accumulation"** function. This works in a similar way to evaluation
  of weighted Contributing area, except that the accumulation is by propagating
  the weight loadings upslope along the reverse of the flow directions to
  accumulate the quantity of loading downslope from each grid cell.
- ``Maximum Downslope Grid [Raster]``: The grid giving the maximum of the weight
  loading grid downslope from each grid cell.
