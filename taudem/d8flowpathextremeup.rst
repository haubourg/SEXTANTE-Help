D8 Extreme Upslope Value
========================

Description
-----------

Evaluates the extreme (either maximum or minimum) upslope value from an input
grid based on the D8 flow model. This is intended initially for use in stream
raster generation to identify a threshold of the slope times area product that
results in an optimum (according to drop analysis) stream network.

If the optional outlet point shapefile is used, only the outlet cells and the
cells upslope (by the D8 flow model) of them are in the domain to be evaluated.

By default, the tool checks for edge contamination. This is defined as the
possibility that a result may be underestimated due to grid cells outside of the
domain not being counted. This occurs when drainage is inwards from the boundaries
or areas with "no data" values for elevation. The algorithm recognizes this and
reports "no data" for the result for these grid cells. It is common to see streaks
of "no data" values extending inwards from boundaries along flow paths that enter
the domain at a boundary. This is the desired effect and indicates that the result
for these grid cells is unknown due to it being dependent on terrain outside of
the domain of data available. Edge contamination checking may be turned off in
cases where you know this is not an issue or want to ignore these problems, if
for example, the DEM has been clipped along a watershed outline.

Parameters
----------

- ``D8 Flow Direction Grid [Raster]``: A grid of D8 flow directions which are
  defined, for each cell, as the direction of the one of its eight adjacent or
  diagonal neighbors with the steepest downward slope. This grid can be obtained
  as the output of the **"D8 Flow Directions"** tool.
- ``Upslope Values Grid [Raster]``: This is the grid of values of which the
  maximum or minimum upslope value is selected. The values most commonly used are
  the slope times area product needed when generating stream rasters according
  to drop analysis.
- ``Outlets Shapefile [Vector]``: Optional. A point shape file defining outlets
  of interest. If this input file is used, only the area upslope of these outlets
  will be evaluated by the tool.
- ``Use maximum upslope value [Boolean]``: A flag to indicate whether the maximum
  or minimum upslope value is to be calculated. Default is **True**.
- ``Check for edge contamination [Boolean]``: A flag that indicates whether the
  tool should check for edge contamination. Default is **True**.

Outputs
-------

- ``Extreme Value Grid [Raster]``: A grid of the maximum/minimum upslope values.
