Length Area Stream Source
=========================

Description
-----------

Creates an indicator grid (1, 0) that evaluates ``A >= (M)(Ly)`` based on upslope
path length, D8 contributing area grid inputs, and parameters ``M`` and ``y``.
This grid indicates likely stream source grid cells. This is an experimental
method with theoretical basis in Hack's law which states that for streams
``L ~ A 0.6``. However for hillslopes with parallel flow ``L ~ A``. So a transition
from hillslopes to streams may be represented by ``L ~ A 0.8`` suggesting
identifying grid cells as stream cells if ``A > M (L (1/0.8))``.

Parameters
----------

- ``Length Grid [Raster]``: A grid of the maximum upslope length for each cell.
  This is calculated as the length of the flow path from the furthest cell that
  drains to each cell. Length is measured between cell centers taking into
  account cell size and whether the direction is adjacent or diagonal. It is this
  length (``L``) that is used in the formula, ``A >(M)(Ly)``, to determine which
  cells are considered stream cells. This grid can be obtained as an output from
  the **"Grid Network"** tool.
- ``Contributing Area Grid [Raster]``: A grid of contributing area values for
  each cell that were calculated using the D8 algorithm. The contributing area
  for a cell is the sum of its own contribution plus the contribution from all
  upslope neighbors that drain to it, measured as a number of cells. This grid
  is typically obtained as the output of the **"D8 Contributing Area"** tool.
  In this tool, it is the contributing area (``A``) that is compared in the
  formula ``A > (M)(Ly)`` to determine the transition to a stream.
- ``Threshold [Number]``: The multiplier threshold (``M``) parameter which is
  used in the formula: ``A > (M)(Ly)``, to identify the beginning of streams.
  Default value **0.03**.
- ``Exponent [Number]``: The exponent (``y``) parameter which is used in the
  formula: ``A > (M)(Ly)``, to identify the beginning of streams. In branching
  systems, Hack's law suggests that ``L = 1/M A(1/y)`` with ``1/y = 0.6`` (or
  0.56) (``y`` about 1.7). In parallel flow systems ``L`` is proportional to
  ``A`` (``y`` about 1). This method tries to identify the transition between
  these two paradigms by using an exponent ``y`` somewhere in between (``y``
  about 1.3). Default value **1.3**.

Outputs

- ``Slope Area Grid [Raster]``: A grid of slope-area values = ``(Sm)(An)``
    calculated from the slope grid, specific catchment area grid, ``m``
    slope exponent parameter, and ``n`` area exponent parameter.
