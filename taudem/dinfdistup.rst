D-Infinity Distance Up
======================

Description
-----------

This tool calculates the distance from each grid cell up to the ridge cells along
the reverse D-infinity flow directions. Ridge cells are defined to be grid cells
that have no contribution from grid cells further upslope. Given the convergence
of multiple flow paths at any grid cell, any given grid cell can have multiple
upslope ridge cells. There are three statictical methods that this tool can use:
maximum distance, minimum distance and waited flow average over these flow paths.
A variant on the above is to consider only grid cells that contribute flow with
a proportion greater than a user specified threshold (t) to be considered as
upslope of any given grid cell. Setting t=0.5 would result in only one flow path
from any grid cell and would give the result equivalent to a D8 flow model,
rather than D-infinity flow model, where flow is proportioned between two
downslope grid cells. Finally there are several different optional paths that can
be measured: the total straight line path (Pythagoras), the horizontal component
of the straight line path, the vertical component of the straight line path, or
the total surface flow path.

Parameters
----------

- ``D-Infinity Flow Direction Grid [Raster]``: A grid giving flow direction by
  the D-infinity method. Flow direction is measured in radians, counter clockwise
  from east. This can be created by the tool **"D-Infinity Flow Directions"**.
- ``Pit Filled Elevation Grid [Raster]``: This input is a grid of elevation
  values. As a general rule, it is recommended that you use a grid of elevation
  values that have had the pits removed for this input. Pits are generally taken
  to be artifacts that interfere with the analysis of flow across them. This grid
  can be obtained as the output of the **"Pit Remove"** tool, in which case it
  contains elevation values where the pits have been filled to the point where
  they just drain.
- ``Slope Grid [Raster]``: This input is a grid of slope values. This is measured
  as drop/distance and it is most often obtained as the output of the **"D-Infinity
  Flow Directions"** tool.
- ``Statistical Method [Selection]``: Statistical method used to calculate the
  distance down to the stream. In the D-Infinity flow model, the outflow from
  each grid cell is proportioned between two downslope grid cells. Therefore, the
  distance from any grid cell to a stream is not uniquely defined. Flow that
  originates at a particular grid cell may enter the stream at a number of cells.
  The distance to the stream may be defined as the longest (maximum), shortest
  (minimum) or weighted average of the distance down to the stream. Default is
  **Average**.
- ``Distance Method [Selection]``: Distance method used to calculate the distance
  down to the stream. One of several ways of measuring distance may be selected:
  the total straight line path (Pythagoras), the horizontal component of the
  straight line path (horizontal), the vertical component of the straight line
  path (vertical), or the total surface flow path (surface). Default is
  **Horizontal**.
- ``Proportion Threshold [Number]``: The proportion threshold parameter where
  only grid cells that contribute flow with a proportion greater than this user
  specified threshold (``t``) is considered to be upslope of any given grid cell.
  Setting ``t=0.5`` would result in only one flow path from any grid cell and
  would give the result equivalent to a D8 flow model, rather than D-Infinity
  flow model, where flow is proportioned between two downslope grid cells.
  Default **0.5**.
- ``Check for Edge Contamination [Boolean]``: A flag that determines whether the
  tool should check for edge contamination. This is defined as the possibility
  that a value may be underestimated due to grid cells outside of the domain not
  being counted. Default **True**.

Outputs
-------

- ``D-Infinity Distance Up [Raster]``: Creates a grid containing the distances
  up to the ridge calculated using the D-Infinity flow model and the statistical
  and path methods chosen.
