D-Infinity Concentration Limited Acccumulation
==============================================

Description
-----------

This function applies to the situation where an unlimited supply of a substance
is loaded into flow at a concentration or solubility threshold Csol over a region
indicated by an indicator grid (dg). It a grid of the concentration of a substance
at each location in the domain, where the supply of substance from a supply area
is loaded into the flow at a concentration or solubility threshold. The flow is
first calculated as a D-infinity weighted contributing area of an input Effective
Runoff Weight Grid (notionally excess precipitation). The concentation of
substance over the supply area (indicator grid) is at the concentration threshold.
As the substance moves downslope with the D-infinity flow field, it is subject
to first order decay in moving from cell to cell as well as dilution due to
changes in flow. The decay multiplier grid gives the fractional (first order)
reduction in quantity in moving from grid cell ``x`` to the next downslope cell.
If the outlets shapefile is used, the tool only evaluates the part of the domain
that contributes flow to the locations given by the shapefile. This is useful for
a tracking a contaminant or compound from an area with unlimited supply of that
compound that is loaded into a flow at a concentration or solubility threshold
over a zone and flow from the zone may be subject to decay or attenuation.

The indicator grid (``dg``) is used to delineate the area of the substance supply
using the (0, 1) indicator function ``i(x)``. ``A[]`` denotes the weighted
accumulation operator evaluated using the D-Infinity Contributing Area function.
The Effective Runoff Weight Grid gives the supply to the flow (e.g. the excess
rainfall if this is overland flow) denoted as ``w(x)``. The specific discharge
is then given by:

::
    Q(x)=A[w(x)]

This weighted accumulation ``Q(x)`` is output as the Overland Flow Specific
Discharge Grid. Over the substance supply area concentration is at the threshold
(the threshold is a saturation or solubility limit). If ``i(x) = 1``, then

::
    C(x) = Csol, and L(x) = Csol Q(x),

where ``L(x)`` denotes the load being carried by the flow. At remaining locations,
the load is determined by load accumulation and the concentration by dilution:

Here ``d(x) = d(i, j)`` is a decay multiplier giving the fractional (first order)
reduction in mass in moving from grid cell ``x`` to the next downslope cell. If
travel (or residence) times ``t(x)`` associated with flow between cells are
available ``d(x)`` may be evaluated as ``exp(-k t(x))`` where ``k`` is a first
order decay parameter. The Concentration grid output is ``C(x)``. If the outlets
shapefile is used, the tool only evaluates the part of the domain that contributes
flow to the locations given by the shapefile.

Useful for a tracking a contaminant released or partitioned to flow at a fixed
threshold concentration.

Parameters
----------

- ``D-Infinity Flow Direction Grid [Raster]``: A grid giving flow direction by
  the D-infinity method. Flow direction is measured in radians, counter clockwise
  from east. This grid can be created by the function **"D-Infinity Flow Directions"**.
- ``Disturbance Indicator Grid [Raster]``: Optional. A grid that indicates the
  source zone of the area of substance supply and must be 1 inside the zone and
  0 or "no data" over the rest of the domain.
- ``Decay Multiplier Grid [Raster]``: A grid giving the factor by which flow
  leaving each grid cell is multiplied before accumulation on downslope grid
  cells. This may be used to simulate the movement of an attenuating or decaying
  substance. If travel (or residence) times ``t(x)`` associated with flow between
  cells are available ``d(x)`` may be evaluated as ``exp(-k t(x))`` where ``k``
  is a first order decay parameter.
- Effective Runoff Weight Grid [Raster]``: A grid giving the input quantity
  (notionally effective runoff or excess precipitation) to be used in the
  D-infinity weighted contributing area evaluation of Overland Flow Specific
  Discharge.
- ``Outlets Shapefile [Vector]``: Optional. This optional input is a point
  shapefile defining outlets of interest. If this file is used, the tool will
  only evaluate the area upslope of these outlets.
- ``Concentration Threshold [Number]``: The concentration or solubility threshold.
  Over the substance supply area, concentration is at this threshold. Default **1.0**.
- ``Check for edge contamination [Boolean]``: This option determines whether the
  tool should check for edge contamination. Edge contamination is defined as the
  possibility that a value may be underestimated due to grid cells outside of the
  domain not being considered when determining contributing area. Default
  **True**.

Outputs
-------

- ``Concentration Grid [Raster]``: A grid giving the resulting concentration of
  the compound of interest in the flow.
