Stream Definition By Threshold
==============================

Description
-----------

Operates on any grid and outputs an indicator (1, 0) grid identifing cells with
input values >= the threshold value. The standard use is to use an accumulated
source area grid to as the input grid to generate a stream raster grid as the
output. If you use the optional input mask grid, it limits the domain being
evaluated to cells with mask values >= 0. When you use a D-infinity contributing
area grid (*sca) as the mask grid, it functions as an edge contamination mask.
The threshold logic is:

::

    src = ((ssa >= thresh) &amp; (mask >= s0)) ? 1:0

Parameters
----------

- ``Accumulated Stream Source Grid [Raster]``: This grid nominally accumulates
  some characteristic or combination of characteristics of the watershed. The
  exact characteristic(s) varies depending on the stream network raster algorithm
  being used. This grid needs to have the property that grid cell values are
  monotonically increasing downslope along D8 flow directions, so that the
  resulting stream network is continuous. While this grid is often from an
  accumulation, other sources such as a maximum upslope function will also produce
  a suitable grid.
- ``Mask Grid [Raster]``: Optional. This optional input is a grid that is used
  to mask the domain of interest and output is only provided where this grid is
  >= 0. A common use of this input is to use a D-Infinity contributing area grid
  as the mask so that the delineated stream network is constrained to areas where
  D-infinity contributing area is available, replicating the functionality of an
  edge contamination mask.
- ``Threshold [Number]``: This parameter is compared to the value in the
  Accumulated Stream Source grid (*ssa) to determine if the cell should be
  considered a stream cell. Streams are identified as grid cells for which ssa
  value is >= this threshold.

Outputs
-------

- ``Stream Raster Grid [Raster]``: This is an indicator grid (1, 0) that indicates
  the location of streams, with a value of 1 for each of the stream cells and 0
  for the remainder of the cells.
