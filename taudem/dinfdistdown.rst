D-Infinity Distance Down
========================

Description
-----------

Calculates the distance downslope to a stream using the D-infinity flow model.
The D-infinity flow model is a multiple flow direction model, because the outflow
from each grid cell is proportioned between up to 2 downslope grid cells. As such,
the distance from any grid cell to a stream is not uniquely defined. Flow that
originates at a particular grid cell may enter the stream at a number of different
cells. The statistical method may be selected as the longest, shortest or weighted
average of the flow path distance to the stream. Also one of several ways of
measuring distance may be selected: the total straight line path (Pythagoras),
the horizontal component of the straight line path, the vertical component of
the straight line path, or the total surface flow path.

Parameters
----------

- ``D-Infinity Flow Direction Grid [Raster]``: A grid giving flow direction by
  the D-infinity method. Flow direction is measured in radians, counter clockwise
  from east. This can be created by the tool **"D-Infinity Flow Directions"**.
- ``Pit Filled Elevation Grid [Raster]``: This input is a grid of elevation
  values. As a general rule, it is recommended that you use a grid of elevation
  values that have had the pits removed for this input. Pits are generally taken
  to be artifacts that interfere with the analysis of flow across them. This grid
  can be obtained as the output of the **"Pit Remove"** tool, in which case it
  contains elevation values where the pits have been filled to the point where
  they just drain.
- ``Stream Raster Grid [Raster]``: A grid indicating streams, by using a grid
  cell value of 1 on streams and 0 off streams. This is usually the output of one
  of the tools in the **"Stream Network Analysis"** toolset.
- ``Weight Path Grid [Raster]``: Optional. A grid giving weights (loadings) to be
  used in the distance calculation. This might be used for example where only flow
  distance through a buffer is to be calculated. The weight is then 1 in the
  buffer and 0 outside it. Alternatively the weight may reflect some sort of cost
  function for travel over the surface, perhaps representing travel time or
  attenuation of a process. If this input file is not used, the loadings will
  assumed to be one for each grid cell.
- ``Statistical Method [Selection]``: Statistical method used to calculate the
  distance down to the stream. In the D-Infinity flow model, the outflow from
  each grid cell is proportioned between two downslope grid cells. Therefore,
  the distance from any grid cell to a stream is not uniquely defined. Flow that
  originates at a particular grid cell may enter the stream at a number of cells.
  The distance to the stream may be defined as the longest (maximum), shortest
  (minimum) or weighted average of the distance down to the stream. Default is
  **Average**.
- ``Distance Method [Selection]``: Distance method used to calculate the distance
  down to the stream. One of several ways of measuring distance may be selected:
  the total straight line path (Pythagoras), the horizontal component of the
  straight line path (horizontal), the vertical component of the straight line
  path (vertical), or the total surface flow path (surface). Default is
  **Horizontal**.
- ``Check for Edge Contamination [Boolean]``: A flag that determines whether the
  tool should check for edge contamination. This is defined as the possibility
  that a value may be underestimated due to grid cells outside of the domain not
  being counted. In the context of Distance Down this occurs when part of a flow
  path traced downslope from a grid cell leaves the domain without reaching a
  stream grid cell. With edge contamination checking selected, the algorithm
  recognizes this and reports no data for the result. This is the desired effect
  and indicates that values for these grid cells is unknown due to it being
  dependent on terrain outside of the domain of data available. Edge contamination
  checking may be overridden in cases where you know this is not an issue or want
  to evaluate the distance using only the fraction of flow paths that terminate
  at a stream. Default **True**.

Outputs
-------

- ``D-Infinity Drop to Stream Grid [Raster]``: Creates a grid containing the
  distance to stream calculated using the D-infinity flow model and the
  statistical and path methods chosen.
